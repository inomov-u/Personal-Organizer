# Project Description

## Overview

Welcome to my personal organization app, a powerful tool designed to streamline task management and enhance productivity. This application is crafted with the philosophy that our brains are optimized for problem-solving, not memorization. By leveraging this app, users can effortlessly remember and organize their tasks, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## Features

- **Someday/Maybe List:** Store ideas or tasks that may not be feasible now but can be revisited in the future.

- **Done List:** Keep track of completed tasks, providing motivation and a sense of accomplishment.

### User-Friendly Views
